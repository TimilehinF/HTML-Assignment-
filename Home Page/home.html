<h2 class="headings"> About Me </h2>
<p>
I was born in Lagos, Nigeria. I currently live in Toronto, Canada. 
<br/>
I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics with a minor in Finance. 
I currently work in estates settlement for a wealth management firm.
<br/>
Outside of my professional life, I enjoy watching movies, reading books and spending time with friends and family.
<br/>
I also, on occasion, practice playing the guitar to justify to myself the impulsive purchase I made many years ago.

<h2 class="headings">Why I Joined the Program</h2>
<p>
Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how technlogy shapes our world
and software engineering is a way for me to channel that curiosity. 
I love problem-solving, and this field gives me the opportunity to take on
complex challenges and see my ideas come to life. The prospect of building a financially rewarding career
is of course a very attractive incentive as well.
</p>
<p> 
I did a lot of research when I trying to figure out how I wanted to go about learning the skills. My major requirement was a learning program 
that would provide detailed information but also a well defined structure for my learning. 
<br/>
AltSchool was recommended to me by a friend and it is a perfect fit for me. 
I like that Altschool offers a wealth of information, learning resources and a good structure for learning. 
It also offers flexibilty which is important to me as I work a full time job. 
</p>
<p>
Picking a program within AltSchool was a bit of a tougher challenge. 
However, I have always been fascinated by the idea of websites come together so frontend engineering seems 
like a good place to start. I also like that I have the option to switch within the school of engineering 
if my interests change.
